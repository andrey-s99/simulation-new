Step-by-step simulation of a 2D world inhabited by herbivores and predators. In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (grass) that herbivores feed on, and static objects that cannot be interacted with - they simply take up space.

The 2D world is an NxM matrix, each creature or object occupies an entire cell, the presence of several objects/creatures in a cell is unacceptable.

This project is a part of a backend roadmap -- https://zhukovsd.github.io/java-backend-learning-course/projects/simulation/
